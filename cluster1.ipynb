    "Hierarchical methods can be either divisive or agglomerative.In hierarchical clustering one can stop at any number of clusters, one find appropriate by interpreting the     dendrogram.Agglomerative methods  begin with ‚Äòn‚Äô clusters and sequentially combine similar clusters until only one cluster is obtained.Divisive methods work in the opposite direction, beginning with one cluster that includes all the records and Hierarchical methods are especially useful when the target is to arrange the clusters into a natural hierarchy.A  hierarchical clustering is a set of nested clusters that are arranged as a tree.Hierarchical clustering don‚Äôt work  as well as, k means when the  shape of the clusters is hyper  spherical."

This elbow point can be used to determine K.Elbow point is used as a cutoff point in mathematical optimization to decide at which point the diminishing returns are no longer worth the additional cost. Similarly, in clustering, this is used to choose a number of clusters when adding another cluster doesn‚Äôt improve the outcomes of modeling.\"The elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use.\" \n",

Silhouette analysis can be used to study the distance between the resulting clusters. This discrete measure ranges between -1 and 1:\n",
